# DSComputing
Some experiments/explorations related to Data Science Computing. Especially covid-19 projections with RNN, and visualizations with interactive map tracker and predictions.


## Project organization
* experiments: folder containing experiments on web scrapping, large file and/or texts manipulation etc.
* covid-19: the project folder employing:
  * web scrapping on US state-level cases, state-level population census, state-level daily weather,  and state-level policy measures and timeframe 
  * RNN (LSTM/GRU) model prediction of cases forcasted 1 day into the future, pytorch implementation
  * visualization of historical trends and predictions with interactive map plot 
* notes: folder containing some starter code courtesy of Dr.Luo  



## Built With

* [pytorch](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
* [plotly](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [sklearn](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to generate RSS Feeds
